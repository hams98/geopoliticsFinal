      The concept of China as an inhabited entity began almost 4,000 years
ago. The birthplace of Chinese civilisation is the region known as the North
China Plain, which the Chinese refer to as the Central Plain. A large, lowlying
tract of nearly 160,000 square miles, it is situated below Inner
Mongolia, south of Manchuria, in and around the Yellow River Basin and
down past the Yangtze River, which both run west to east. It is now one of
the most densely populated areas in the world.<br><br>
The Yellow River basin is subject to frequent and devastating floods,
earning the river the unenviable sobriquet of ‘Scourge of the Sons of Han’.
The industrialisation of the region began in earnest in the 1950s and has
been rapidly accelerating in the last three decades. The terribly polluted river
is now so clogged with toxic waste that it sometimes struggles even to reach
the sea. Nevertheless the Yellow River is to China what the Nile is to Egypt
– the cradle of its civilisation, where its people learnt to farm, to make paper
and gunpowder.<br><br>
To the north of this proto-China were the harsh lands of the Gobi Desert
in what is now Mongolia. To the west the land gradually rises until it
becomes the Tibetan Plateau, reaching to the Himalayas. To the south-east
and south lies the sea.<br><br>
The heartland, as the North China Plain is known, was and is a large,
fertile plain with two main rivers and a climate that allows rice and soy
beans to be harvested twice a season (double-cropping), which encouraged
rapid population growth. By 1500 BCE in this heartland, out of hundreds of
mini city-states, many warring with each other, emerged the earliest version
of a Chinese state – the Shang dynasty. This is where what became known as
the Han people emerged, protecting the heartland and creating a buffer zone
around them.<br><br>
The Han now make up over 90 per cent of China’s population and they
dominate Chinese politics and business. They are differentiated by
Mandarin, Cantonese and many other regional languages, but united by
ethnicity and at a political level by the geopolitical impulsion to protect the
heartland. Mandarin, which originated in the northern part of the region, is
by far the dominant language and is the medium of government, national
state television and education. Mandarin is similar to Cantonese and many
other languages when written, but very different when spoken.
The heartland is the political, cultural, demographic and – crucially –
the agricultural centre of gravity. About a billion people live in this part of
China, despite it being just half the size of the United States, which has a
population of 322 million. Because the terrain of the heartland lent itself to
settlement and an agrarian lifestyle, the early dynasties felt threatened by the
non-Han regions which surrounded them, especially Mongolia with its
nomadic bands of violent warriors.<br><br>
