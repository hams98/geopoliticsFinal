      INDIA AND PAKISTAN CAN AGREE ON ONE THING: NEITHER wants the other one around. This is somewhat
      problematic given that they share a 1,900-mile long border. Each country
      fairly bristles with antagonism and nuclear weapons, so how they manage
      this unwanted relationship is a matter of life and death on a scale of tens of
      millions.
      <br>
      <br>
      India has a population approaching 1.3 billion people, while Pakistan’s
      is 182 million. Impoverished, volatile and splintering, Pakistan appears to
      define itself by its opposition to India, while India, despite obsessing about
      Pakistan, defines itself in many ways, including that of being an emerging
      world power with a growing economy and an expanding middle class. From
      this vantage point it looks across at Pakistan and sees how it outperforms it
      on almost all economic and democratic indicators.

      <br>
      <br>
      They have fought four major wars and many skirmishes. Emotions run
      hot. An oft-quoted remark by a Pakistani officer that Pakistan would make
      India bleed by a thousand cuts was addressed in late 2014 by military analyst
      Dr Amarjit Singh writing in the Indian Defence Review: ‘Whatever others
      may believe, my opinion is simply that it is better for India to brave a costly
      nuclear attack by Pakistan, and get it over with even at the cost of tens of
      millions of deaths, than suffer ignominy and pain day in and day out through
      a thousand cuts and wasted energy in unrealized potential.’ That may not
      reflect official government policy, but it is an indication of the depth of
      feeling at many levels in both societies. Modern Pakistan and India were
      born in fire; next time the fire could kill them.
       <br>
      <br>
      The two are tied together within the geography of the Indian
      subcontinent, which creates a natural frame. The Bay of Bengal, the Indian
      Ocean and the Arabian Sea are respectively to the south-east, south, and
      south-west, the Hindu Kush to the north-west, and the Himalayas to the
      north. Moving clockwise, the plateau of the Baluchistan Desert climbs
      steadily before becoming the mountains of the North West Frontier, which
      rise even higher to become the Hindu Kush. A right turn east connects to the
      Karakoram Range, which then leads to the Himalayas. They sweep right
      along the border with China all the way to Burma. From there, as India
      curves around Bangladesh, the terrain descends south to the Bay of Bengal.
      The interior of the frame contains what are modern-day India, Pakistan,
      Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan. The latter two are impoverished landlocked
      nations dominated by their giant neighbours, China and India. Bangladesh’s
      problem is not that it lacks access to the sea, but that the sea has too much
      access to Bangladesh: flooding from the waters of the Bay of Bengal
      constantly afflicts the low-lying territory. Its other geographical problem is
      that it is almost entirely surrounded by India, because the 2,545-mile long
      frontier, agreed in 1974, wrapped India around Bangladesh, leaving it only a
      short border with Burma as an alternative land route to the outside world.
