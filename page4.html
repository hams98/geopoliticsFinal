      RUSSIA IS VAST. IT IS VASTEST. IMMENSE. IT IS SIX MILLION square miles vast, eleven time zones vast; it
      is the largest country in the world.
      Its forests, lakes, rivers, frozen tundra, steppe, taiga and mountains are
      all vast. This size has long seeped into our collective consciousness.
      Wherever we are, there is Russia, perhaps to our east or west, to our north or
      south – but there is the Russian Bear.<br><br>
      It is no coincidence that the bear is the symbol of this immense nation.
      There it sits, sometimes hibernating, sometimes growling, majestic, but
      ferocious. Bear is a Russian word, but the Russians are also wary of calling
      this animal by its name, fearful of conjuring up its darker side. They call it
      medved, ‘the one who likes honey’.
      At least 120,000 of these medveds live in a country which bestrides
      Europe and Asia. To the west of the Ural Mountains is European Russia. To
      their east is Siberia, stretching all the way to the Bering Sea and the Pacific
      Ocean. Even in the twenty-first century, to cross it by train takes six days.
      Russia’s leaders must look across these distances, and differences, and
      formulate policy accordingly; for several centuries now they have looked in
      all directions, but concentrated mostly westward.<br><br>
      The thin end of this wedge is Poland. Here, the vast North European
      Plain stretching from France to the Urals (which extend 1,000 miles south to
      north, forming a natural boundary between Europe and Asia) is only 300
      miles wide. It runs from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Carpathian
      Mountains in the south. The North European Plain encompasses all of
      western and northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands, northern Germany
      and nearly all of Poland.<br><br>
      From a Russian perspective this is a double-edged sword. Poland
      represents a relatively narrow corridor into which Russia could drive its
      armed forces if necessary and thus prevent an enemy from advancing
      towards Moscow. But from this point the wedge begins to broaden; by the
      time you get to Russia’s borders it is over 2,000 miles wide, and is flat all the
      way to Moscow and beyond. Even with a large army you would be hardpressed
      to defend in strength along this line. However, Russia has never
      been conquered from this direction, partially due to its strategic depth. By
      the time an army approaches Moscow it already has unsustainably long
      supply lines, a mistake that Napoleon made in 1812, and that Hitler repeated
      in 1941.<br><br>
      Likewise, in the Russian Far East it is geography that protects Russia. It
      is difficult to move an army from Asia up into Asian Russia; there’s not
      much to attack except for snow, and you could only get as far as the Urals.
      You would then end up holding a massive piece of territory, in difficult
      conditions, with long supply lines and the ever-present risk of a counterattack.
      You might think that no one is intent on invading Russia, but that is not
      how the Russians see it, and with good reason. In the past 500 years they
      have been invaded several times from the west. The Poles came across the
      North European Plain in 1605, followed by the Swedes under Charles XII in
      1708, the French under Napoleon in 1812, and the Germans twice, in both
      world wars, in 1914 and 1941. Looking at it another way, if you count from
      Napoleon’s invasion of 1812, but this time include the Crimean War of
      1853–6 and the two world wars up to 1945, then the Russians were fighting
      on average in or around the North European Plain once every thirty-three
      years.<br><br>
      At the end of the Second World War in 1945, the Russians occupied the
      territory conquered from Germany in Central and Eastern Europe, some of
      which then became part of the USSR, as it increasingly began to resemble
      the old Russian Empire. In 1949 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
      (NATO) was formed by an association of European and North American
      states, for the defence of Europe and the North Atlantic against the danger of
      Soviet aggression. In response, most of the Communist states of Europe –
      under Russian leadership – formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955, a treaty for
      military defence and mutual aid. The Pact was supposed to be made of iron,
      but with hindsight by the early 1980s was rusting, and after the fall of the
      Berlin Wall in 1989 it crumbled to dust.<br><br>
