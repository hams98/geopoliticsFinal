        THE MIDDLE OF WHAT? EAST OF WHERE? THE REGION’S very name is based on a European view of the
        world, and it is a European view of the region that shaped it. The Europeans
        used ink to draw lines on maps: they were lines that did not exist in reality
        and created some of the most artificial borders the world has seen. An
        attempt is now being made to redraw them in blood.<br><br>
        One of the most important pieces of video to emerge from the Middle
        East in 2014 was overshadowed that year by footage of explosions and
        beheadings. It is a piece of slick propaganda by Islamic State and shows a
        bulldozer wiping, or rather pushing, the Iraqi–Syrian border out of existence.
        The border is simply a high berm of sand. Move the sand and the border no
        longer physically exists. This ‘line’ still exists in theory. The next few years
        will determine whether those words of the Islamic State fighter are
        prophetic, or mere bravado: ‘We are destroying the borders and breaking the
        barriers. Thanks be to Allah.’
        After the First World War, there were fewer borders in the wider Middle
        East than currently exist, and those that did exist were usually determined by
        geography alone. The spaces within them were loosely subdivided and
        governed according to geography, ethnicity and religion, but there was no
        attempt to create nation states.<br><br>
        The Greater Middle East extends across 1,000 miles, west to east, from
        the Mediterranean Sea to the mountains of Iran. From north to south, if we
        start at the Black Sea and end on the shores of the Arabian Sea off Oman, it
        is 2,000 miles long. The region includes vast deserts, oases, snow-covered
        mountains, long rivers, great cities and coastal plains. And it has a great deal
        of natural wealth in the form that every industrialised and industrialising
        country around the world needs – oil and gas.<br><br>
        It also contains the fertile region known as Mesopotamia, the ‘land
        between the rivers’ (the Euphrates and Tigris). However, the most dominant
        feature is the vast Arabian Desert and scrubland in its centre which touches
        parts of Israel, Jordan, Syria, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Yemen and most of Saudi
        Arabia including the Rub’ al Khali or ‘Empty Quarter’. This is the largest
        continuous sand desert in the world, incorporating an area the size of France.
        It is due to this feature not only that the majority of the inhabitants of the
        region live on its periphery, but also that until European colonisation most of
        the people within it did not think in terms of nation states and legally fixed
        borders.<br><br>
        The notion that a man from a certain area could not travel across a
        region to see a relative from the same tribe unless he had a document,
        granted to him by a third man he didn’t know in a faraway town, made little
        sense. The idea that the document was issued because a foreigner had said
        the area was now two regions and had made up names for them made no
        sense at all and was contrary to the way in which life had been lived for
        centuries.
