My plan massively changed from 7  to 8.

Accessible:I have used a color contrast to make the globe easily visible.

C. **Description**

I. What is the purpose of your website? ii. What information do you convey with your website?
The purpose of my website is to teach the audience about geo-politics. In the wake of the
Ukraine-Russia war, information about geopolitics is more important than ever.
There are however no resources on the web to understand such a pertinent yet complex 
Issue. I want to convey in a concise manner what the conflict of a particular region are..

iii. How is it interesting and engaging?

I have made a spinning globe in the center of the page to make the audience drawn 
to the website. The website is animated, inviting, and engaging. It uses a lot of empty space 
to its advantage. If you double-click on the pink points, you are taken to understand the
geopolitics of the region. At the top of each page is a carousal of pictures which is
another fun interaction.

iv. Who is the target audience?
For those who are interested in geography or anyone wanting to learn about geopolitics 
a concise and succint manner.


**D. Interactions by the user.**

The earth at the center of the first page is movable with the help of a mouse. It is also rotating around 
it's axis. There are some objects on the earth that are clickable and they will be redirected to other pages
where there is succinct information about geopolitics on the other pages.


1. Click on pink globes to understand geo-politics in that region
2. Interact with the carousal in the individual html pages

**E. External libraries**
i.Names of tool
Three.js and Bootstrap

ii. Why did you choose to use it? (2-4 sentences max)
I wanted to create 3D objects and create interactivity and hence I chose to use
Three.js. I also wanted to try 3D modeling for the first time.
I used bootstrap minimally to easily design HTML pages.

iii.
How do you use it? (2-4 sentences max)
Three.js was used to create the spinning earth at the center of the first page.
As part of Three.js, we need three things: scene, camera, and renderer so that we can render the scene with a 
camera. I wrapped a 2d image onto a sphere to make it look like a globe.
I also made use of custom shaders to make an atmosphere around the earth to make it look real.
I created interactivity by allowing the gobe to be spun with a mouse and make the pink points clickable.

iv.
What does it add to your website? (2-4 sentences max)

Three.js adds sophistication and professionalism to the website. There is curiosity about what the website could
be about and that is something I wanted to incorporate.

**f.Iteration from HW7**
Initially I was planning on using the D3 librabry and make an interactive 2D map. I changes the idea to focus more on 3D modelling.
No particular reason to ierate but I thought aethetically it would look cooler.

**g. Major challenges: **
1. Hosting the website was a big challenge as I was using a programming langauge called OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) for the custom shaders and
was challenging to debug.
2. Building a co-ordinates for the sphere was also challenging.
